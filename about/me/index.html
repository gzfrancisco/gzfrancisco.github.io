<h1>About me</h1>

<blockquote><p>The definition of myself is only valid today, tomorrow don't know who I'll become.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>I'm Francisco Granados Gómez, economist and software engineer</strong>. Milenial born and raised in Mexico city.</p>

<h3>As an economist</h3>

<p>I studied in México’s IPN (Instituto Politécnico Nacional) and have a degree in economic sciences. Major in financial econometrics. In highschool, I studied some accounting and I worked doing tax returns in my spare time. It’s funny and has been really helpful in my professional life.</p>

<h3>Music inspector, my alias</h3>

<h3>As an engineer</h3>

<p>At the end of highschool and during my social service (no, I am not a criminal, we have to do it since my school is funded by the government) I had a teacher there who introduced me to Adobe Flash and Dreamweaver. So I spent the next school holidays studying beacuase I wanted to learn more about them.</p>
<p>Jump in time... (sorry but I'm tired working on my blog so I'll later write this part)</p>
<p>I have worked on web platforms since 2008 with Moodle for IPN ESCA. I did some SCORM projects and many interactive developments. Developing client applications is my strongest skill. I have developed Desktop clients with Adobe Air, Web applications with Flash, Flex, HTML5 and recently iOS and Android Apps.</p>
<p>In 2012 I became an iOS and Ruby developer. In that time I have worked in more than 10 projects. Some of them in Ruby on Rails Backend, and some others in iOS (client) for iPad apps and Universal apps.</p>
<p>I am currently an instructor and developer in HTML5+JS+CSS3, Ruby and iOS technologies.</p>
