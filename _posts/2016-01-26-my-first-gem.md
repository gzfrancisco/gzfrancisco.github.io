# My first gem



## Seed env

In my last 2 years after taking a lot of Ruby on Rails projects and have the same problem I decided to make a Gem for RoR to solve my first problem in the development of new features and development environments from new code bases.

Is a simple gem that calls a seed.rb file for environment. Here I found many projects with the same problem. They use FactoryGirl for testing but not for development and don't have a simple mode to add new objects to the database for development proposed. So every time I had to create a simple line to load an external file for the environment at the time ``rake db:seed`` is called from the command line.

So, right now I made this gem called [seed_env](https://rubygems.org/gems/seed_env) that have a simple command ``rails generate seed_env:install`` and create the 3 started files for each environment and add a statement in the seeds.rb

Problem solved! nobody has to decide if they use FactoryGirl or create their objects in a development database. We can use a seed.rb for each environment.

It sound really simple, but there isnâ€™t a gem for that, so I took the opportunity to create my first gem and publish into RubyGems. I feel great.
