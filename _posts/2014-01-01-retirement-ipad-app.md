# Retirement iPad App

At the end of 2013 came into my hands one project about retirement and mobile devices. Android 4+ and iPad.

But I estimate bad one spread sheet which have a lots of formulas. In this project some formulas have the GoalAndSeek function (available only in MS Excel) so we have to write down in Objective-C and Java.

We learn much about the financial operation for this product and all the data behind. Was a difficult project but at the end, we deliver to the AppStore and the Google Play at the end of the year.
