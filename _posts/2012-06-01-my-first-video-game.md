# My first video game

> I had done many games/interactives in my past jobs but never a beat them all video game.

Was my first project at Raku and I was a young ActionScript 3 developer with a lot of experience on animations and interactive interfaces.

I develop an ActorBase class which controlls all the movement for any player or enemie. Also I create the HUD, the collision system and another parts of the game screens like the player customization.

Was made in Adobe Flash with Gradle build system. We were 3 developers with 5 designers and a lot of energy.
